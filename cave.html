    <header><h2>The Cave</h2></header>
    <article>
        at Chauvet,
        in ochre and charcoal
        strokes, throws horns, tusks, and teeth
        against ironstained rock.
        
        These hordes tempt flight
        as they tempt meaning.
        
        In every pattern,
        we project
        modern myth—we project
        our own writing.
        
        In The Republic (some
        thirty-four millennia later), firelight
        paints.
        
        Bored of existence, we
        built brushes—we
        built schools
        and newer schools
        
        and the tools to break them.
        
        Yet, a short sentence
        ago, in the book of anthropology
        warm wind lured philosophers in
        through columns of its own carving
        
        to reveal indifferent handprints
        that ask: Have we ever left
        
        the cave?
