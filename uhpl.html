    <p>I joined Dr. Philip Kellman and the UCLA Human Perception Lab winter of my senior year. Our focus is on perceptual learning&mdash; improvements in ability to pick up patterns and stimuli from the environment through experience, often just brief practice.

        Initially, I assisted Dr. Kellman and his two graduate students carried out their studies on (1) improving accuracy of rapid radiological diagnoses and (2) improving visual path recognitionâ€“ <strong>coding research protocols</strong>, briefing and <strong>running participants</strong>, and <strong>editing papers</strong>. After seeing those projects through, I launched my own experiment, studying implicit sensory cueing in perceptual learning&mdash; both visual and auditory. I am currently working with Dr. Kellman to conclude and publish this project.
        
        Throughout my time, I&#39;ve deeply investigated the literature in visual and auditory perception, perceptual learning, and learning technology.
