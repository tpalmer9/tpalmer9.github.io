        Moss ambient — this Sound
        (, Puget,) mist crisps leaves, tops of ponds, fronds of ferns
        in a bronze ripple. Sap rises slow
        up softwood long and lean and
        marigold specks scratch streaks through evergreen.

        Spring
        ing from branch to brook, the interplay
        of sixorso (woodwind virtuosos
        trading solos) flutters. I sit, ear
        bouncing around clutter, crossed legs
        flinching from dew leaves
        up the hill where grass grows
        warmer. Yellow slowly swallows
        my curled arms, struggling
        to trap time
        as stable,
        steady tempo,
        in lap.

        Wind tunes the forest.
        Needle drops—hollow logs charge—
        cones stir wings, stones turn
        waves. Strapped with a curved cedar
        chamber, its net strung in nylon,
        I catch but a feather. Over mornings,
        its echo aches. They wither in song.
        In song, louder. Over mornings,
        my carved timbre shakes
        and tries my hand in dueling impressions:

        Fall
        of minor
        out to sea /
        homeward flood
        in major key /
        threepitch pluck
        updown the neck /
        Fleet Fox hum
        harmony.
