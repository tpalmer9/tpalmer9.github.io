        By weathered crossroads and tattered wood sign, Lena Lake leaves
        its dayhikers behind. The trail narrows, ceding to creeping green,
        blown spores since grown, and limbs, delicately adorned — this algaefungus
        symbiosis, draping almost to floor.

        Usnea, I recall
        the genus. That’s all.

        The name will never be of use.
        Today, its life is a referent. Today, to me, its life,
        a symbol I once read.

        But these gradients: sweeping grey/like-sage/like-mint/like-pistachio
        These textures: filigree filaments—Some spun silk, some knotted noise
        These rhythms: Threads spread across baroque, barked architecture.

        The name will never be of use.

        Stopping/Standing/Staring, still as I can, still
        puffing/pumping/cramping/crunching, still
        breathing/beating/bleating/blushing/rushing. Still
        much, much too synth

        for the humid-hungry, the sulfur-sensitive,
        for the all-absorbing — too brass

        for The Valley of Silent Men
        and it’s bearded old growth — too staccato

        for the creek-carved-hollow rock grotto
        running down its ravine — too mezzopiano

        to hear all the drips
        of these sick and dying
        trees.
