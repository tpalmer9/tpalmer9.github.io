    <header><h2>“The Zone of Interest” and Psychological Detachment from Genocide</h2></header>
    <article><em>By Thomas Palmer, May 2024</em>


        <strong>“The Zone of Interest,” a film adaptation of a Martin Amis novel by the same name, confronts viewers with the ease of psychological detachment and dissociation from genocide.</strong> The film depicts the stark contrast between the horrors of the Holocaust and the mundane lives of its perpetrators, inducing a self-reflection that is strengthened by the film’s prioritization of truth over audience satisfaction, its meticulous sound design, and the psychological depth of the actors’ portrayals.

        The Holocaust—the systematic, state-sponsored genocide of six million Jews, along with millions of others, at the hands of Nazi Germany and its allies during World War II—was a genocide at an incomprehensible scale, and the extent of the horror is impossible to capture in any piece of media. Film and media nonetheless have responsibility to preserve its cultural memory and shape the education of generations that follow. Among the many films made centered on this horrific chapter of history, Jonathan Glazer’s film stands out from conventional approaches with an entirely new perspective. 
        
        The visual narrative depicts commandant Rudolf Höss and his wife as they attempt to build a life for their family in a large house adjacent to Auschwitz. The camp beyond the garden wall is only seen in tops of buildings. The visual window into the otherwise unremarkable lives of Commandant Höss and his family show human traits and activities that may look familiar. However, the near-constant, unavoidable audio of the film creates an entirely different atmosphere. An ambiguous, low-frequency rumble through various scenes treads the line between an unnerving soundtrack and real sounds of unseen events. Although, at times, we clearly hear furnaces, trains, a distinct scream, while at some points looking at inconspicuous scenes, like the Höss children playing in the garden. These vividly disturbing sounds hardly crack their façade. As Glazer puts it: “Genocide becomes ambient to their life.” (Klein, 2024) We witness the Höss family emotionally separate themselves as suffering has become background noise. At times, the film induces us to do the same—visually ignoring events we only hear fragments of or see references to—events that should be holding our attention. 
        
        This constant, unsettling sound design with only fragments of visual evidence unsettlingly engages imagination—instead of confronting us with scenes of fictional recreations inside Auschwitz that on an implicit level we know are actors, your imagination is forced to fill in those gaps. “It would be inexcusable and deadly wrong to say that The Zone of Interest is about people living in blissful ignorance about what’s going on just over the garden wall. They know exactly what’s happening” (Wilkinson, 2023) Thoughts about the people experiencing this history, make it extremely tense, even without a disturbing visual in front of us. Viewing this film, we are trapped inside the disconnect and the psychological detachment that the Höss family lived within. “Everyone had to be occupied with activity all the time, because if you stop, you think. And, if you think, you reflect,” Glazer said in an interview. (O’Hagan, 2023) We are shown a psychological mirror to the ease of detachment and complicity.
        

        <strong>Any historical film walks the balance between accuracy and narrative engagement. With an atrocity at such a scale and significance as the holocaust, it is critical not to exploit suffering and trauma with a dramatization.</strong> “As you watch a movie, you’re always looking to making sense of it. And sometimes, as with our film, it just doesn’t make sense. How do you make sense of 6 million people being murdered? It’s impossible.” (McQueen, 2024) Hollywood, driven by money and entertainment, often risks this by appealing to glorification and emotional security of audiences. A pertinent example of what I would call a conventional Hollywood portrayal of the holocaust is the film “Schindler’s List.” It has both the narrative and cinematic structure of typical entertaining Hollywood movies and is highly acclaimed from popular sources like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. It leans much heavier on the side of audience satisfaction and has faced backlash for its superficial dramatization of the traumatic events of the holocaust. “Schindler’s List” gives the consumer personal separation with a commanding narrative, melodramatic score, and a happy ending. 
        
        While the film closed with real-life footage of those and the descendants of those who survived with the help of Schindler, but there still exists a separation between all the people one sees on the screen, and you—the viewer. As Stanley Kubrick said in his critique: “The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. Schindler’s List is about 600 who don’t.” (Freedland, 2023) Viewers are engaged with the narrative but aren’t given enough opportunity to engage with the history and cultural significance that it derives the narrative from. The mental separation between the viewer and the genocide is reinforced.
        
        The film “Shoah”, on the other side of the spectrum, presents the Holocaust with an unflinching commitment to raw testimony and preservation of historical fact. Director Claude Lanzmann spent more than 11 years making it, insisting on presenting history “without adornment.” (Turan, 2018) The result is a 9-hour epic that refuses any sort of reenactments or fictionalized elements. One of his goals was to powerfully evokes the past using only images of the present. This approach forces viewers to directly confront the stark realities without catharsis or narrative redemption. It is a testament that genocide demands a devotion to truth that surpasses conventional Hollywood storytelling. 
        
        “Occupied City”, another film released in 2023, extends the conversation of holocaust representation in film, exploring Amsterdam under Nazi occupation. It weaves together narratives from the past with the present-day city, inviting viewers to consider the lasting history in contemporary life. It directly shows even less of the holocaust than “The Zone of Interest,” yet similarly, keeps it ever-present in our imagination. “Where once Dutch Nazi volunteer drivers gathered, today teenagers practise ballet. Where the deportation of Amsterdam’s Jews was organised, now there are kids in backpacks wearing AirPods.” (Freedland, 2023) It invites us to consider how quickly human psychology and perceived progress can cover up the traces of our atrocities.
        
        
        <strong>One of the most impactful qualities in films like “Occupied City” and “The Zone of Interest” is that the most important character is you, the viewer. These films confront us with our complicity and emotional detachment from suffering that happens beyond our immediate perception—a poignant message about our detachment from global humanitarian crises.</strong> We hear about suffering and see glimpses of it in media, yet it remains at the periphery of our consciousness, easily ignored amidst the noise of everyday life. “[G]enocide is becoming ambient once more – at least for those of us fortunate enough to live on the safe sides of the many walls that carve up our world.” (Klein, 2024) “The Zone of Interest” is not only a historical film about the holocaust. It concerns the genocides and crimes against humanity that have become ambient to our own lives. Whether it’s the ongoing conflict in Gaza, Yemen, or Ukraine, or other recent genocides in Rwanda, Sudan, Myanmar, to name just a few, we don’t struggle to emotionally distance ourselves, making it easier to continue with our daily lives, unaffected. “Its challenge to its audience is to become attuned to the sounds that are not heard any more. To regain the capacity to detect when states drift towards immorality, and social institutions become violent and corrupted.” (Higgins, 2024) Glazer’s film asks us to examine our own willingness to remain indifferent to the suffering we don’t see—to the suffering that isn’t our loved ones, our neighbors, or our fellow citizens.
        
        As of May 23, 2024, more than 36,000 people have been killed in Gaza, 15,000 of which were children. Close to 100,000 people are injured and more than 10,000 are missing. More than half of Gaza’s homes have been destroyed or damaged, 80% of commercial facilities and 85% of school buildings damaged, 83% of groundwater wells are not functioning, and only 15 out of 35 hospitals are at least partially functional. Some 1.7 million people displaced, and starvation is currently bearing down on Palestinians, with children increasingly facing death from hunger and dehydration. Israel continues to ignore international courts and western governments continue to fund and fuel Israel.
        
        As citizens, workers, and students under one of such governments—those fortunate to live in physical safety and privileged with the choice to live in emotional safety—this genocide has become ambient. The timeless message that Glazer sends through his film is of the continual dehumanization of populations targeted for slaughter, and how this dehumanization is reinforced and perpetuated by our very own psychological withdrawal. The film’s narrative is focused in on only the Höss family, but the effect of this psychological mirror spans far beyond the film’s direct scope. It prompts us to consider the continuity of dehumanization and our willing detachment from the social and governmental actions that exacerbate it. 
        
        
        <strong>The experience of psychological detachment that I describe can be both conscious and subconscious, and most often acts as an emotional self-defense mechanism.</strong> Further, it is not only the perpetrators and spectators that dissociate themselves from their reality as a self-preservation measure. One haunting example, heard in in “Shoah,” is an interview with a barber that cut the hair of groups of women during the holocaust, some of which he knew, right before they were executed. At one point he interrupts to say: “Working there day and night […] you feel disappeared. You were dead.” (2011) As humans, we often disconnect ourselves from pain, suffering, and death subconsciously or because we can’t imagine a way to live on with these horrible truths. When death and suffering are all around, this dissociation is a reaction that protects a sense of humanity. Whether intentionally or subconsciously, dissociation is a psychological system to preserve emotion, humanity, and keep one from being swallowed by self-loathing or numbness.
        
        In "The Zone of Interest," we witness this phenomenon from the side of the perpetrators. When Rudolph tells her that he is to be transferred, Frau Höss is furious: for her, Auschwitz is everything they ever dreamed of—their own little piece of paradise—and she refuses to give it up. She, evidently, has separated herself from the death and suffering on the other side of the garden wall. Unflinchingly, she is shown trying on a fur coat that we infer to have belonged to one of the victims. The key difference between these two cases is their position relative to the genocide. For the Barber, the dissociation is a way to cope with the unimaginable horror that he has to experience with no control over his situation, time and time again. For Hedwig and the Höss family, this psychological separation is both a privilege and a comfort.

        Examining one’s accountability as a spectator with the privilege to psychologically detach themselves is crucial to Glazer’s message. “Complicity is only half the story. Worse would be to resign ourselves to confused thoughtlessness. It takes courage to understand when we are committing crimes, and to call out others when they do.” (Stonebridge, 2024) The comfort that this detachment provides doesn’t only have individual, personal implications. It permeates across communities and populations. It further dehumanizes the victims and the innocent by having their suffering reduced to background noise. 
        

        <strong>Genocide is a humanitarian crisis. It transcends the populations and players directly involved by inflicting suffering, pain, and death on civilians and innocent people.</strong> On the UCLA campus, the first encampment protest in support of Palestine was pitched on April 25th. It grew rapidly, demanding that UCLA divest from companies with financial ties to Israel and acknowledge Palestinian lives and statehood. It grew in parallel with the volume of counter-protesters, progressively agitating the encampment at night. This culminated to more hostile methods, such as attempts to dismantle the barricades and set off fireworks, and eventually to the police moving in to clear it out on May 2nd. Another encampment formed yesterday, May 23rd. In the Westwood community, many with the comfort of psychological detachment assert that students can’t get to a library, or to their class, with little engagement with the cause of the encampment. I cannot argue that this psychological separation is malevolent. However, in the face of genocide, this detachment dehumanizes innocent people facing suffering, displacement, and death.
        
        <strong>“The Zone of Interest” is more than a film about ordinary people being complicit in extraordinary evil. Its power lies in the psychological mirror it holds up to the viewer, pushing audiences to examine how they may be separating themselves from genocides and humanitarian crises.</strong> While it is essential to protect our mental health, we must also remain engaged and accountable in giving other humans, including those across the globe, the humanity that they deserve. Historical films made on genocides, humanitarian crises, or suffering for that matter, have an immense responsibility to commit to truth. They play a critical role in shaping our awareness as well as cultural memory. They have enormous power to inspire empathy and social change. “The Zone of Interest” is a brilliant example of film that pushes both approaches Holocaust film and the psychological discussion of audiences living through genocide. We, as humans, have a commitment to recognize and defend the humanity of those that it is taken away from.
