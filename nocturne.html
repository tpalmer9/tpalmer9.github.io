    <header><h2>Nocturne</h2></header>
    <article>
        <em>Time</em> gives little mercy, and wavers in taste. Like reverberating strings, it
        <em>Is</em> suspended by hollow, restless darkness. Tossing and fighting
        <em>The</em> stillness, I found your chronicled pieces: resonant, incendiary. Deeper: your
        <em>Best</em> phrases scratched out—all the purged pages. You were the
        <em>Critic</em> you despised the most. In your fire, copies still survived
        
        <em>And</em> spread from desk to desk to the wood of my piano stand. Practicing
        <em>Patience,</em> I absorbed those unsingable lines. Swollen with 
        <em>The</em> melancholic melodies, notes resounding night—the
        <em>Best</em> time to feel alone—Ear bent, studying you, my first
        <em>Teacher</em>—flowing sound to my fingers through tingling veins.
        
        <em>—</em>
        <em>Frédéric</em>
        <em>Chopin</em>
