    <header><h2>Why play</h2></header>
    <article>
        piano? the alchemist
        of harmony— to muddle many colors, or stretch a single blue
        wide as taffy, thin as glass.

        guitar? the weaver
        meets each string in fingertips— to touch vibration itself, and
        cradle its calls in palm.

        drums? both spine
        and spinal cord— to balance the room with thumping vertebrae,
        and clicks/claps/taps of subtly tuned nerves.

        Why play

        with the wind? —the voice? the reed? the brass?
        Is there a nearer expression of the artist soul
        than that which permeates through living breath?
