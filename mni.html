    <p>I develop and deploy immersive, multisensory artistic experiences through wearable haptic technology. My work spans end-to-end&mdash; from refining our hardware and software to QA testing, UX research, and real-time technical troubleshooting. At live events, I ensure every participant can engage with the art through intuitive, accessible, and deeply felt interactions.

        This work is about more than devices&mdash; it's about expanding what's possible through haptics as both a new artistic medium and a force for strengthening community. The project began as a way to create inclusive concert experiences for deaf and hard of hearing audiences, but has since evolved to promote the artistic medium of curated vibration, enabling communities to harness this new language through vibrotextiles. We've integrated our technology with music, performance art, and animation to create entirely new forms of expression.

        Currently, I’m spearheading a rebrand and strategic expansion of this work under the <strong>Music: Not Impossible</strong> project. In parallel, I’m advancing R&D through Not Impossible Labs’ <strong>VybLife project</strong>, exploring how our technology can support individuals with Parkinson’s disease as well as expand into new and underexplored therapeutic contexts.</p>
