    <p>Working directly under the head of A&R, every day was different. On some, I pulled track data from streaming services to conduct <strong>trend analyses</strong>. On others, I helped recording sessions run smoothly by troubleshooting technical problems, assisting with <strong>audio engineering</strong>, and making runs for clients.

With data collection being a core function for artist discovery, I developed scripts to <strong>automate data collection</strong> from DSPs such as Spotify and Soundcloud with web API calls. This saved ample time for myself and my teammates, allowing us to focus on making smart, creative decisions to grow the young electronic dance music label.
