    <article>        [I]
        
        To be treebark, tortoiseshell, lighthouse, raincoat
        To be this
        for
        
            —tank blocks,
        chiseled concrete pressed into page of turf, pulling seconds
        apart via retinal nerve—
        
                                words
        , is drafting
        . Is decorating space/time
        as simple as
        
        an umbrella, unfurled, upside-down on the floor
        collecting spills, sipping on slips of the 
        Freud?
        
        
        [II]
        
        There is architecture in an inkwell
        deep as a mountain quarry, still stuck on its stiff quill
        
        and there is an architecture that lets space speak 
        that admits the orbit of light and fortifies its each and 
        only detail 
        
        <em>Is there a better description of a cube
        than that
        of its construction?</em>
        
        
        [epilogue]
        
        Perhaps one that, restrained in the face
        of war, of interpretation and assimilation, of disruption and time
        ‘s mercurial taste, stands, sturdy 
        at its destination.
