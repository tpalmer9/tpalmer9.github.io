    <p>As a summer intern at Fetti, an early-stage tech startup, I took ownership of two central tasks: marketing and user research.

Launching marketing campaigns on social platforms using organic posts and partnerships, I acquired some 500 of the earliest users in UCLA, LMU, and USC communities. Leveraging Zapier and HubSpot, I tracked and refined <strong>acquisition strategies</strong>, focusing on user-centered approaches that increased of engagement and conversion rate.

I conducted <strong>usability studies</strong>&mdash; first 1:1 calls, then automated surveys&mdash; to find and understand target user goals and pain points. I used the insights to suggest <strong>design and functionality enhancements</strong> directly to the CTO.
