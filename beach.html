    <article> <em>After Edgar Bowers</em>

        I’ll go among the dead to see my friend.
        The place I leave is tranquil: the forest
        calms coastline as live anchors in the bluff
        and, stretching its indifferent gills, engulfs
        the cutting echoes of twisting car roads
        so that alone, in peace, I may drift off.
        
        I cannot go, although I should pretend,
        in mercurial rooms of memory,
        he stands as always: my wide-eyed ally.
        And yet the thought of going makes the trees
        wave, and eager leaves, like my silent sighs,
        shed over sea to join wind’s elegy.
